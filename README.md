## Backstory
<p>
I was bored and I wanted to learn PHP. And there was this one university subject that I had to pass. It was about web security, and the assignment was to plant a webshell on a server. Come to think of it, why don't I just make my own webshell? So I did.

## Is it secure?
<p>
Although I've add some security measures, this webshell wasn't even ever meant to be secure. It was made to be simple and easy to understand. It is not recommended to use this webshell on a production server. If you want to use it in it, just don't.
</p>

## How to use
<p>
Just deploy shella.php on your server and access it. You will not be prompted for a password, so you can just start using it.

## Prerequisites
- Write Access to The Directory Where You Deploy the Webshell
